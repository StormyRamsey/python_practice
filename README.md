 #python_practice

Why did you choose this subject?
Python is a language I've wanted to learn for a long time.

How were you first made aware of it?
I was made aware of Python through a code school for women.

What problem does it solve?
Python makes programming accessible to more people.

How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?

Why does one use it?
Python is a simple and powerful language.

What are the alternatives?
Java 

What is it similar to, if anything?
Ruby 

What is the history of this technology?
Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation began in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the operating system Amoeba.

Who built it and why?
During Van Rossum's stay at CNRI, he launched the Computer Programming for Everybody (CP4E) initiative, intending to make programming more accessible to more people, with a basic "literacy" in programming languages, similar to the basic English literacy and mathematics skills required by most employers. Python served a central role in this: because of its focus on clean syntax, it was already suitable, and CP4E's goals bore similarities to its predecessor, ABC. The project was funded by DARPA.[13] As of 2007, the CP4E project is inactive, and while Python attempts to be easily learnable and not too arcane in its syntax and semantics, reaching out to non-programmers is not an active concern.

Who is maintaining it?
Python.org Maintenance and Administration

What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
I enjoyed learning Python and I can see myself going very deep into this language.

What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
I did not encounter any hurdles.
